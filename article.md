The rain tapped gently against the window, creating a soft rhythm in the quiet room. A single lamp cast a warm glow over the scattered pages on the desk. Somewhere in the distance, a train whistle echoed, reminding me that the world was still moving, even as I sat lost in thought.

I reached for my pen, its weight familiar and comforting in my hand. Words began to flow, hesitant at first, then gathering momentum like the rain outside. Each sentence built upon the last, weaving together memories and hopes, fears and dreams.

Outside, the world was shrouded in mist, the streetlights casting halos on the wet pavement. I wondered who else was awake at this hour, who else found solace in the quiet hush of midnight. The rain continued its gentle song, and I wrote on, letting the night carry me forward.
